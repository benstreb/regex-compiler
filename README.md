Compiles a regex to a python file for import.

Usage:
regex.py PATTERN FILENAME
regex.py --test

Note that this was primarily a learning experience for me, and so the supported subset of regular expressions is extremely limited. Accordingly, and given that the generated code is not at all efficient, this program is not suitable for practical use.
